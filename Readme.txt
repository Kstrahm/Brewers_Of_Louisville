Hello,

This is the readme for my final project.  This project is for Code Louisville.  It is a website with a list of some breweries here in Louisville, KY.  

To Run:
1. Open index.html
2. Explore links from the nav bar

Goals for today
    add jquery event under contact.html button element
    add shadowbox view for images
    create an additional media query
